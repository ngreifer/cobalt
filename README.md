## [![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://img.shields.io/cran/v/cobalt?color=%230047ab)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cobalt) [![CRAN_Downloads_Badge](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/cobalt?color=%230047ab)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cobalt)

### Overview

Welcome to `cobalt`, which stands for **Co**variate **Bal**ance
**T**ables (and Plots). `cobalt` allows users to assess balance on
covariate distributions in preprocessed groups generated through
weighting, matching, or subclassification, such as by using the
propensity score. `cobalt`’s primary function is `bal.tab()`, which
stands for “balance table”, and is meant to replace (or supplement) the
balance assessment tools found in other R packages. To examine how
`bal.tab()` integrates with these packages and others, see the help file
for `bal.tab()` with `?bal.tab`, which links to the methods used for
each package. Each page has examples of how `bal.tab()` is used with the
package. There are also five vignettes detailing the use of `cobalt`,
which can be accessed at `vignette("cobalt")`: one for basic uses of
`cobalt`, one for the use of `cobalt` with additional packages, one for
the use of `cobalt` with multiply imputed and/or clustered data, one for
the use of `cobalt` with longitudinal treatments, and one for the use of
`cobalt` to generate publication-ready plots. Currently, `cobalt` is
compatible with output from `MatchIt`, `twang`, `Matching`, `optmatch`,
`CBPS`, `ebal`, `WeightIt`, `designmatch`, `sbw`, `MatchThem`, and `cem`
as well as data not processed through these packages.

### Why cobalt?

Most of the major conditioning packages contain functions to assess
balance; so why use `cobalt` at all? `cobalt` arose out of several
desiderata when using these packages: to have standardized measures that
were consistent across all conditioning packages, to allow for
flexibility in the calculation and display of balance measures, and to
incorporate recent methodological recommendations in the assessment of
balance. In addition, `cobalt` has unique plotting capabilities that
make use of `ggplot2` in R for balance assessment and reporting.

Because conditioning methods are spread across several packages which
each have their idiosyncrasies in how they report balance (if at all),
comparing the resulting balance from various conditioning methods can be
a challenge. `cobalt` unites these packages by providing a single,
flexible tool that intelligently processes output from any of the
conditioning packages and provides the user with both useful defaults
and customizable options for display and calculation. `cobalt` also
allows for balance assessment on data not generated through any of the
conditioning packages. In addition, `cobalt` has tools for assessing and
reporting balance for clustered data sets, data sets generated through
multiple imputation, and data sets with a continuous treatment variable,
all features that exist in very limited capacities or not at all in
other packages.

A large focus in developing `cobalt` was to streamline output so that
only the most useful, non-redundant, and complete information is
displayed, all at the user’s choice. Balance statistics are intuitive,
methodologically informed, and simple to interpret. Visual displays of
balance reflect the goals of balance assessment rather than being steps
removed. While other packages have focused their efforts on processing
data, `cobalt` only assesses balance, and does so particularly well.

New features are being added all the time, following the cutting edge of
methodological work on balance assessment. As new packages and methods
are developed, `cobalt` will be ready to integrate them to further our
goal of simple, unified balance assessment.

### Examples

Below are examples of `cobalt`’s primary functions:

``` r
library("cobalt")
data("lalonde", package = "cobalt")

#Nearest neighbor matching with MatchIt
m.out <- MatchIt::matchit(treat ~ age + educ + race + married +
                              nodegree + re74 + re75,
                          data = lalonde)

#Checking balance before and after matching:
bal.tab(m.out, thresholds = c(m = .1), un = TRUE)
```

Please remember to cite this package when using it to analyze data. For
example, in a manuscript, you could write: “Matching was performed using
the *Matching* package (Sekhon, 2011), and covariate balance was
assessed using *cobalt* (Greifer, 2023), both in R (R Core Team, 2023).”
Use `citation("cobalt")` to generate a bibliographic reference for the
`cobalt` package.
