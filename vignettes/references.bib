  abstract = {Although published works rarely include causal estimates from more than a few model specifications, authors usually choose the presented estimates from numerous trial runs readers never see. Given the often large variation in estimates across choices of control variables, functional forms, and other modeling assumptions, how can researchers ensure that the few estimates presented are accurate or representative? How do readers know that publications are not merely demonstrations that it is possible to find a specification that fits the author's favorite hypothesis? And how do we evaluate or even define statistical properties like unbiasedness or mean squared error when no unique model or estimator even exists? Matching methods, which offer the promise of causal inference with fewer assumptions, constitute one possible way forward, but crucial results in this fast-growing methodological literature are often grossly misinterpreted. We explain how to avoid these misinterpretations and propose a unified approach that makes it possible for researchers to preprocess data with matching (such as with the easy-to-use software we offer) and then to apply the best parametric techniques they would have used anyway. This procedure makes parametric models produce more accurate and considerably less model-dependent causal inferences.},

This study assessed the performance of various balance measures, including a proposed balance measure based on the prognostic score (similar to a disease risk score), to determine which balance measures best correlate with bias in the treatment effect estimate. Study Design and Setting The correlations of multiple common balance measures with bias in the treatment effect estimate produced by weighting by the odds, subclassification on the propensity score, and full matching on the propensity score were calculated. Simulated data were used, based on realistic data settings. Settings included both continuous and binary covariates and continuous covariates only. Results The absolute standardized mean difference (ASMD) in prognostic scores, the mean ASMD (in covariates), and the meant-statistic all had high correlations with bias in the effect estimate. Overall, prognostic scores displayed the highest correlations with bias of all the balance measures considered. Prognostic score measure performance was generally not affected by model misspecification, and the prognostic score measure performed well under a variety of scenarios. Conclusion Researchers should consider using prognostic score-based balance measures for assessing the performance of propensity score methods for reducing bias in nonexperimental studies.},

  abstract = {The propensity score is defined as a subject's probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups. We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample. The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher-order moments, and interactions. The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study. We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of `best practice' when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.

  abstract = {Purpose Propensity score (PS) methods focus on balancing confounders between groups to estimate an unbiased treatment or exposure effect. However, there is lack of attention in actually measuring, reporting and using the information on balance, for instance for model selection. We propose to use a measure for balance in PS methods and describe several of such measures: the overlapping coefficient, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, and the L\'evy distance. Methods We performed simulation studies to estimate the association between these three and several mean based measures for balance and bias (i.e., discrepancy between the true and the estimated treatment effect). Results For large sample sizes (n\,=\,2000) the average Pearson's correlation coefficients between bias and Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance (r\,=\,0.89), the L\'evy distance (r\,=\,0.89) and the absolute standardized mean difference (r\,=\,0.90) were similar, whereas this was lower for the overlapping coefficient (r\,=\,-0.42). When sample size decreased to 400, mean based measures of balance had stronger correlations with bias. Models including all confounding variables, their squares and interaction terms resulted in smaller bias than models that included only main terms for confounding variables. Conclusions We conclude that measures for balance are useful for reporting the amount of balance reached in propensity score analysis and can be helpful in selecting the final PS model.

  abstract = {Background Conditional on the propensity score (PS), treated and untreated subjects have similar distribution of observed baseline characteristics when the PS model is appropriately specified. The performance of several PS balance measures in assessing the balance of covariates achieved by a specific PS model and selecting the optimal PS model was evaluated in simulation studies. However, these studies involved only normally distributed covariates. Comparisons in binary or mixed covariate distributions with rare outcomes, typical of pharmacoepidemiologic settings, are scarce. Methods Monte Carlo simulations were performed to examine the performance of different balance measures in terms of selecting an optimal PS model, thus reduction in bias. The balance of covariates between treatment groups was assessed using the absolute standardized difference, the Kolmogorov\textendash Smirnov distance, the L\'evy distance, and the overlapping coefficient. Spearman's correlation coefficient (r) between each of these balance measures and bias were calculated. Results In large sample sizes (n\,{$\geq$}\,1000), all balance measures were similarly correlated with bias (r ranging between 0.50 and 0.68) irrespective of the treatment effect's strength and frequency of the outcome. In smaller sample sizes with mixed binary and continuous covariate distributions, these correlations were low for all balance measures (r ranging between 0.11 and 0.43), except for the absolute standardized difference (r\,=\,0.51). Conclusions The absolute standardized difference, which is an easy-to-calculate balance measure, displayed consistently better performance across different simulation scenarios. Therefore, it should be the balance measure of choice for measuring and reporting the amount of balance reached, and for selecting the final PS model.

  abstract = {In this article, we study the causal inference problem with a continuous treatment variable using propensity score-based methods. For a continuous treatment, the generalized propensity score is defined as the conditional density of the treatment-level given covariates (confounders). The dose\textendash response function is then estimated by inverse probability weighting, where the weights are calculated from the estimated propensity scores. When the dimension of the covariates is large, the traditional nonparametric density estimation suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Some researchers have suggested a two-step estimation procedure by first modeling the mean function. In this study, we suggest a boosting algorithm to estimate the mean function of the treatment given covariates. In boosting, an important tuning parameter is the number of trees to be generated, which essentially determines the trade-off between bias and variance of the causal estimator. We propose a criterion called average absolute correlation coefficient (AACC) to determine the optimal number of trees. Simulation results show that the proposed approach performs better than a simple linear approximation or L2 boosting. The proposed methodology is also illustrated through the Early Dieting in Girls study, which examines the influence of mothers' overall weight concern on daughters' dieting behavior.},

PSM is thus uniquely blind to the o en large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or a er pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data.

In this paper, we extend the CBPS to a continuous treatment. We propose the covariate balancing generalized propensity score (CBGPS) methodology, which minimizes the association between covariates and the treatment. We develop both parametric and nonparametric approaches and show their superior performance over the standard maximum likelihood estimation in a simulation study. The CBGPS methodology is applied to an observational study, whose goal is to estimate the causal effects of political advertisements on campaign contributions. We also provide open-source software that implements the proposed methods.},

In this setting, matching, subclassification, imputation or inverse probability weighting on the propensity score can reduce the initial covariate bias between the treatment and control groups. With more than two treatment options, however, estimation of causal effects requires additional assumptions and techniques, the implementations of which have varied across disciplines. This paper reviews current methods, and it identifies and contrasts the treatment effects that each one estimates. Additionally, we propose possible matching techniques for use with multiple, nominal categorical treatments, and use simulations to show how such algorithms can yield improved covariate similarity between those in the matched sets, relative the pre-matched cohort. To sum, this manuscript provides a synopsis of how to notate and use causal methods for categorical treatments.},

Like propensity scores, prognostic scores can reduce the dimension of the covariate, yet causal inferences conditional on them are as valid as are inferences conditional only on the unreduced covariate. As a method of adjustment unto itself, prognostic scoring has limitations not shared with propensity scoring, but it holds promise as a complement to the propensity score, particularly in certain designs for which unassisted propensity adjustment is difficult or infeasible.},

Conditional on the propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of observed baseline covariates. Propensity-score matching is a commonly used propensity score method for estimating the effects of treatment on outcomes. Balance diagnostics have been previously described for use when 1:1 matching on the propensity score is employed. We illustrate that these methods can be misleading when many-to-one matching on the propensity score is employed. We then propose modifications of these methods that involve weighting each untreated subject by the inverse of the number of untreated subjects in the matched set. We describe both quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the balance in baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects in a sample obtained by many-to-one matching on the propensity score. The quantitative method uses the weighted standardized difference. The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects in the weighted sample. We illustrate our methods using a large sample of patients discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of a heart attack (acute myocardial infarction). The exposure was receipt of a prescription for a statin at hospital discharge. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

When planning a study that will be analyzed with IPTWs, determining the required sample size for a given level of statistical power is challenging because of the effect of weighting on the variance of the estimated causal means. This paper considers the utility of the design effect to quantify the effect of weighting on the precision of causal estimates. The design effect is defined as the ratio of the variance of the causal mean estimator divided by the variance of a na\"ive estimator if, counter to fact, no confounding had been present and weights were not needed. A simple, closed-form approximation of the design effect is derived that is outcome invariant and can be estimated during the study design phase. Once the design effect is approximated for each treatment group, sample size calculations are conducted as for a randomized trial, but with variances inflated by the design effects to account for weighting. Simulations demonstrate the accuracy of the design effect approximation, and practical considerations are discussed.},

While the data collection is rapidly moving forward, there are few if any agreed upon methods for analyzing the data. Much of the attention has been on benchmarks for the race distribution of stops and searches. Little empirical work has advanced our understanding of the influence of race in the post-stop activities of police. The present study proposes a propensity score technique to determine the extent to which race bias affects citation rates, search rates, and the duration of the stop. Adjusting for confounding variables using the propensity score offers an alternative to multivariate regression that is more interpretable, less prone to errors in model assumptions, and ultimately easier to present to stakeholders in policing practices. An analysis of traffic stop data from the City of Oakland, California demonstrates the process, presentation, and interpretation of the results that the methodology produces. Ultimately, the study addresses the extent to which race plays a role in officers' use of discretion.},

Commonly used propensity-score methods include covariate adjustment using the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, and propensityscore matching. Empirical and theoretical research has demonstrated that matching on the propensity score eliminates a greater proportion of baseline differences between treated and untreated subjects than does stratification on the propensity score. However, the analysis of propensity-score-matched samples requires statistical methods appropriate for matched-pairs data. We critically evaluated 47 articles that were published between 1996 and 2003 in the medical literature and that employed propensity-score matching. We found that only two of the articles reported the balance of baseline characteristics between treated and untreated subjects in the matched sample and used correct statistical methods to assess the degree of imbalance. Thirteen (28 per cent) of the articles explicitly used statistical methods appropriate for the analysis of matched data when estimating the treatment effect and its statistical significance. Common errors included using the log-rank test to compare Kaplan\textendash Meier survival curves in the matched sample, using Cox regression, logistic regression, chi-squared tests, t-tests, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests in the matched sample, thereby failing to account for the matched nature of the data. We provide guidelines for the analysis and reporting of studies that employ propensity-score matching. Copyright q 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Problems include improper use of hypothesis tests for covariate balance between the treated and control groups, and the consequences of using randomization, blocking before randomization and matching after assignment of treatment to achieve covariate balance. Applied researchers in a wide range of scientific disciplines seem to fall prey to one or more of these fallacies and as a result make suboptimal design or analysis choices. To clarify these points, we derive a new four-part decomposition of the key estimation errors in making causal inferences. We then show how this decomposition can help scholars from different experimental and observational research traditions to understand better each other's inferential problems and attempted solutions.},

The typical models used to analyze observational data (e.g., least squares regressions, difference of difference methods) involve outcomes, and so cannot be used for design in this sense. Because the propensity score is a function only of covariates, not outcomes, repeated analyses attempting to balance covariate distributions across treatment groups do not bias estimates of the treatment effect on outcome variables. This theme will the primary focus of this article: how to use the techniques of matching, subclassification and/or weighting to help design observational studies. The article also proposes a new diagnostic table to aid in this endeavor, which is especially useful when there are many covariates under consideration. The conclusion of the initial design phase may be that the treatment and control groups are too far apart to produce reliable effect estimates without heroic modeling assumptions. In such cases, it may be wisest to abandon the intended observational study, and search for a more acceptable data set where such heroic modeling assumptions are not necessary. The ideas and techniques will be illustrated using the initial design of an observational study for use in the tobacco litigation based on the NMES data set.},

We also consider newer classes of causal models, including marginal structural models, that can assess questions of the joint effects of time-varying exposures and can take into account feedback between the exposure and outcome over time. Such feedback renders cross-sectional data ineffective for drawing inferences about causation.ResultsThe challenges are illustrated by analyses concerning potential effects of religious service attendance on depression, in which there may in fact be effects in both directions with service attendance preventing the subsequent depression, but depression itself leading to lower levels of the subsequent religious service attendance.ConclusionsLongitudinal designs, with careful control for prior exposures, outcomes, and confounders, and suitable methodology, will strengthen research on mental health, religion and health, and in the biomedical and social sciences generally.},
